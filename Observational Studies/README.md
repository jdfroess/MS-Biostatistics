# Observational Studies

This course focused on further understanding causal inference through propensity score methods and sensitivity analysis. This is an important concept in data analysis because causal conclusions are difficult to obtain from observational studies. This is because unknown confounders affect the study and can't be measured. But by using these different causal inference techniques can help better form conclusions about the outcome being measured.
