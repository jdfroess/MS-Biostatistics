# Statistical Methods

This was the introductory course to statistics using R that I took at CWRU. This course covered basic statistical methods in R such as building plots using `ggplot` and how to create numerical summaries based on if the variable is continuous, binary, or categorical. This course also included learning to use linear regression and basic cross validation techniques.

# Projects

Two different projects were done in this course one was analyizing a survey that was created and filled out by the class. The other was anaylizing Stanford's mass shooting database to try and predict the number of victims in a mass shooting. Both of these projects were done as more of an overall review of the course material and to show a strong understanding of data management and analysis.
