# Statistical Methods II

This course was a continuation of the Statistical Methods I course at CWRU. This added an understanding of more complex statistical methods such as logistic regression, model selection, multiple imputation, adding non linear terms, and more. These statistical methods were then further understood by doing two different projects. The first project is predicting kickstarter success by using linear regression, logistic regression, and model selection.
