# Homework 4 Description

This assignment focuses on using a cox model with all the covariates in the data and use model selection techniques to find the best covariates to predict the outcome. The model selection techniques that are used focus on using AIC to pick the best model. The focus on AIC is done through forward, backward, and stepwise model selection. Using all of these model selection techniques helps show how different covariates are picked to be in the final model.
